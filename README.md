# Arduino side of the branch
For now there is still a lot of work to be done. But eventually, this will be the receiver of the binary bitstream from the host machine and the it will begin the process of writing to the eeprom.

#Compilation instruction
For now the project here is only compatible with the arduino ide (might change it over to avr-gcc if it makes sense) and with an Arduino Mega 2560. Tweaks can be made to perhaps work with other arduinos.
